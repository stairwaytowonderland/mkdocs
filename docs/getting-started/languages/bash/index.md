# Bash

## Overview

The `bash` shell is the most common shell in Linux/Unix systems and also called the GNU shell. It is a superset of the `sh` shell, so everything that works there also works in `bash`.

Here the language structure and special use cases will be explained.

## Syntax

**Comments**: use `#` to start a comment

**Commands**: calls the function, built-in or within the `PATH`

**Arguments**: separated by spaces behind the command

**Exits Status**: the integer return value which is `0` for success: [exit codes](./exit-codes.md)

**Shebang**: `#!/bin/bash` as first line is used to run script as `bash` if executed

## Redirection and Pipes

There are three file descriptors: `STDIN` (0), `STDOUT` (1) and `STDERR` (2) which can be used.
They can be directed into a file or piped as `STDIN` to the next command.


| Redirection                   | Code Example                   |   |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|---|
| `STDOUT` to file              | `ls -l > ls-l.txt`             |   |
| `STDERR` to file              | `grep da * 2> grep-errors.txt` |   |
| `STDOUT` to `STDERR`          | `grep da * 1>&2`               |   |
| `STDERR` to `STDOUT`          | `grep * 2>&1`                  |   |
| `STDOUT` and `STDERR` to file | `grep da * &> grep-errors.txt` |   |
| pipe `STDOUT`                 | `ls -l                         | grep "\.txt$"`   |
| pipe `STDOUT` and `STDERR`    | `ls -l                         | & grep "\.txt$"` |
| pipe only `STDERR`            | `ls -l >/dev/null 2>&1         | grep "\.txt$"`   |

## Variables

A variable is created by setting a value to it like `test="xxxx"`.
They are only accessible in the current shell. To make them also available to sub shells you have to `export` it.

The following types of variables are possible:

- String variables
- Integer variables
- Constant variables
- Array variables

Within functions local variables can be defined by using the `local` prefix.

The following variables have special use cases:

| Variable          | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Functions

To define functions two types are possible:

```bash
function quit {
    exit
}

hello () {
    echo Hello!
}

hello
quit
```

Parameters given to the functions are readable as `$1`... like from any command.

## Expansion

**Brace expansion** is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings may be generated. Patterns to be brace-expanded take the form of an optional PREAMBLE, followed by a series of comma-separated strings between a pair of braces, followed by an optional POSTSCRIPT. The preamble is prefixed to each string contained within the braces, and the postscript is then appended to each resulting string, expanding left to right.

Brace expansions may be nested. The results of each expanded string are not sorted; left to right order is preserved:

```bash
$ echo sp{el,il,al}l
spell spill spall
```

**Variable expansion** will replace a variable with it's content,

**Command substitution** will replace a command with it's output before evaluating the outer line.

```bash
$(command)
# backticks alternative
`command`
```

**Arithmetic expansion** allows the evaluation of an arithmetic expression and the substitution of the result. The format for arithmetic expansion is:

```bash
$(( EXPRESSION ))
```

The expression is treated as if it were within double quotes. All tokens in the expression undergo parameter expansion, command substitution, and quote removal. Arithmetic substitutions may be nested.

Evaluation of arithmetic expressions is done in fixed-width integers with no check for overflow - although division by zero is trapped and recognized as an error. The operators are roughly the same as in the C programming language. In order of decreasing precedence, the list looks like this:

| Operator                                                          | Meaning                                    | | | |

**File name expansion** is done using `*`, `?`, and `[`. If one of these characters appears, then the word is regarded as a `PATTERN`, and replaced with an alphabetically sorted list of file names matching the pattern. If no matching file names are found, and the shell option `nullglob` is disabled, the word is left unchanged.

## Conditionals

```bash
if [ "foo" = "foo" ]; then
    echo expression evaluated as true
else
    echo expression evaluated as false
fi
```

## Test Conditions

In Bash there are different extensions to write conditions:

1. `[ ... ]` is POSIX command
2. `[[ ... ]]` is a Bash extension

`[[ X ]]` is a single construct that makes `X` be parsed magically. `<`, `&&`, `||` and `()` are treated specially, and word splitting rules are different. There are also further differences like `=` and `=~`.

| Type                         | POSIX                                                       | Bash               | | | | |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --- | ------------------- |
| `<`                          | `[ a \< b ]` comparison needs `\` <br>else redirects output | `[[ a < b ]]`      |
| `&&` or `                    |                                                             | `                  | `[ a = a ] && [ b = b ]` <br>deprecated: `[ a = a -a b = b ]`              | `[[ a = a && b = b ]]` |
| `(`                          | `([ a = a ]                                                 |                    | [ a = b ]) && [ a = b ]`<br>deprecated:`[ \( a = a -o a = b \) -a a = b ]` | `[[ (a = a             |     | a = b) && a = b ]]` |
| word splitting <br>`x='a b'` | `[ "$x" = 'a b' ]` <br>quotes needed to prevent expand      | `[[ $x = 'a b' ]]` |
| `=` or `==`                  | `printf 'ab'                                                | grep -Eq 'a.'`     | `[[ ab = a? ]]` pattern matching applies                                   | |
| `=~` or `!~`                 | `printf 'ab'                                                | grep -Eq 'ab?'`    | `[[ ab =~ ab? ]]` POSIX regexp                                             | |

As you see the bash expressions are often better readable.

| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| .        | Matches any single character.                                                                                   |
| ?        | The preceding item is optional and will be matched, at most, once.                                              |
| \*       | The preceding item will be matched zero or more times.                                                          |
| +        | The preceding item will be matched one or more times.                                                           |
| {N}      | The preceding item is matched exactly N times.                                                                  |
| {N,}     | The preceding item is matched N or more times.                                                                  |
| {N,M}    | The preceding item is matched at least N times, but not more than M times.                                      |
| -        | represents the range if it's not first or last in a list or the ending point of a range in a list.              |
| ^        | Matches the empty string at the beginning of a line; also represents the characters not in the range of a list. |
| $        | Matches the empty string at the end of a line.                                                                  |
| \b       | Matches the empty string at the edge of a word.                                                                 |
| \B       | Matches the empty string provided it's not at the edge of a word.                                               |
| \<       | Match the empty string at the beginning of word.                                                                |

## Loops

Bash has three different kind of loops:

1. The `for` loop is a little bit different from other programming languages. Basically, it let's you iterate over a series of 'words' within a string.
2. The `while` executes a piece of code if the control expression is `true`, and only stops when it is `false`.
3. The `until` loop is almost equal to the `while` loop, except that the code is executed while the control expression evaluates to `false`.

Each loop may be exited using `break` or continued with the next round using `continue`.

```bash
for i in $( ls ); do
    echo item: $i
done
```

The variable `i` will take the different values contained in `$( ls )`.
The block enclosed in `do` and `done` is executed in each iteration.

To use `for` as a counter use the range support of bash:

```bash
for i in {1..10}; do
    echo $i
done
```

But you can also use a C-like for loop:

```bash
for (( c=1; c<=5; c++ )); do
   echo "Welcome $c times"
done
```

In `while` and `until` you give the condition at the start and use a code block like used in `for`:

```bash
COUNTER=0
while [  $COUNTER -lt 10 ]; do
    echo The counter is $COUNTER
    let COUNTER+=1
done
```

```bash
COUNTER=20
until [  $COUNTER -lt 10 ]; do
    echo COUNTER $COUNTER
    let COUNTER-=1
done
```

## Options

Shell options can either be set different from the default upon calling the shell, or be set during shell operation.
To change an option use `set -<option>`to enable or `set +<option>` to disable an option.

| Option      | Usage                                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `noclobber` | prevents existing files from being overwritten by redirection operations |
| `noglob`    | prevents special characters from being expanded                          |
| `u`         | treat unset variables as an error                                        |
| `x`         | set debug mode which will print each expanded command before executing   |

## Include modules

Using the `source <path>` command the given script will be included like it is directly written there the `source` command is set.

A relative path is based on the current directory of the calling shell.
